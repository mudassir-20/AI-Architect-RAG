# 🏗️ The AI Architect-RAG

# Enterprise RAG Agent with Self-Correction

The Architect is an enterprise-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions from large documents reliably, safely, and transparently.

Unlike basic RAG demos, this project implements multi-agent self-correction, source-aware answers, and automatic web fallback, closely mirroring how production AI systems are built in real companies.

## 🚀 Key Features

**📄 Document-based Question Answering**

Answers questions strictly from a provided PDF (NVIDIA Annual Report) using semantic search.

**🧠 Multi-Query Retrieval**

Automatically rewrites user queries into multiple semantic variants to improve recall.

**🔁 Multi-Agent Self-Correction Pipeline**

* Answer Agent – generates an initial response
* Critic Agent – evaluates correctness, grounding, and clarity
* Refiner Agent – improves the answer based on critic feedback

**🛑 Hallucination Control**

* Verifies whether answers are supported by document context
* Responds with “I don’t know based on the document” when appropriate

**🌐 Web Search Fallback**

* Automatically detects external questions
* Uses web search (Tavily API) when the document does not contain the answer
* Clearly separates document-based vs web-based answers

**🧾 Source-Aware Responses**

* Adds page-level citations for document answers
* Never attaches document sources to web-based answers

**💬 Conversational Memory**

Maintains short-term chat history for follow-up questions

**⚙️ FastAPI Deployment**

* Exposes the agent via a clean /ask API endpoint
* Ready for frontend integration or production deployment
